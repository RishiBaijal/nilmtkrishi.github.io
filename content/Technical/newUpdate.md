Summary: A new direction

I applied for a BTP in order to continue working on this project. As it turns out, we will be heading in a new direction - NIOMTK. 

NIOMTK
------

As a part of NIOMTK, I will be buiding a toolkit that is used to detect occupancy of a particular home in a Non-Intrusive fashion - hence the naeme Non-Intrusive occupancy monitoring. There are multiple research papers that I am currently reading. One of them was presented at BuildSys 2013, authored by Dong Chen, Sean Barker, Adarsh Subbaswamy, David Irwin and Prashant Shenoy. I presented this paper at a group meeting over a google hangout. There are other interesting research papers on this topic. I will write about them as I present them over the course of the semester. 

I plan to get started with the implementation of the system soon. We will be looking at two to three datasets and two to three algorithms, one of them being the thresholding approach. More updates will come as the semester goes on.
