Summary: AMPDs data set converter's is finally done

So after a lot of deliberation, the AMPds converter is finally complete. It is now a part of the nilmtk project and I am now officially one of the nilmtk contributors. It feels pretty good to know that my code is actually a part of a big project. This was also my first pull request, and work on the nilmtk project has resulted in my longest github streak so far - 5 days! I know it is not much, but I am hoping that that duration will go up soon in the future.
