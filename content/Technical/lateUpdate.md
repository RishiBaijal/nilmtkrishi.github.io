Summary: Late update

Sorry about the late update. This week has been crazy with all the deadlines from college. The latest task that I have been assigned includes incorporating the nilm-eval framework with the nilmtk framework. It seems like a pretty challenging task. I Ihave started working on it. I have gone through the paper that was published along with nilm-eval. I am going through the accompanying thesis (I am about one-fourth of the way through it). I will keep the updates coming.
