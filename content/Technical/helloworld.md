Summary: The story behind this blog


I guess I should have made this post about a month ago, but better late than never. You might have read on the about page that I am working on this project as a part of my college curriculum and the first task that I was given was setting up this blog. Setting up a blog shouldn't be such a big deal. However, when I was actually given this task, ESYA was going on. If you are a IIIT student and you have organized an event at ESYA before, you don't need to read any further. You know exaclty how this is going to go so you might as well utilise your time doing something more productive.For the rest of you, here it is - ESYA is the technical festival of IIIT Delhi and I was the organizer of Hunt IT - the IIIT treasure hunt. ESYA was finally coming to a close and back at that time, I was extremely busy with whatever work I had to do over there. Once ESYA finally got over, I got around to setting this up and the rest is history. Why did I tell you this? Because it looks much better than a post that says "This is where I will keep track of my progress on the NILMTK project."
