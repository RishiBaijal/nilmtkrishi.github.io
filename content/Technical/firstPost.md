Summary: Notebooks and Textbooks.

For the past few weeks, I have been reading 'Python for data analytics' by Wes McKiney. It delves into the various tools that are available to python users for various analytical techniques. The most prominent tools that have been used thus far are - numpy, pandas and matplotlib. The first two have been practically ubiquitous, while matplotlib has been used mostly for plotting purposes. I have completed the book for the most part - aside from a few doubts and I have summarized three of the chapters which deal with numpy, pandas and one concerning data storage and loading. These correspond to chapters 4, 5 and 6 in the textbook.
