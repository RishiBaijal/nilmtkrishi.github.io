Summary: A new direction

So my next task sounds challenging, but also fun. The project seems to be headed in a fresh direction. As a part of the next task, I have been assigned to study a thesis and a paper about the nilm-eval framework. This framework was built in order to provide a standard method to test nilm algorithms. The creators of this framework have tested it on four different algorithms - supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. The dataset used to test it was the ECO dataset.

I have gone through the paper and I now have some idea as to what the nilm-eval framework is all about. I will be reading the thesis in order to get a more detailed overview about the whole framework. As usual, I will keep posting updates as frequently as possible.
